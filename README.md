# 🏗️ Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze sensor data and assess the health of civil structures like bridges and buildings. It helps identify early signs of damage or stress in infrastructure based on patterns in sensor readings.

## 🎯 Objective

To predict the condition of structures (damaged or healthy) by training ML models on historical sensor data. The goal is to enhance safety and reduce maintenance costs through early detection.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook or Streamlit (if applicable)

## 📊 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Feature selection
- ML model training (e.g., Random Forest, SVM)
- Model evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall)
- Predictions: Damaged vs Healthy state
- Visualizations for data and model output

## 📁 Dataset

_(Add or edit based on what you used)_

The dataset contains structural readings such as:
- Acceleration
- Strain
- Vibration frequency
- Temperature
- Label: Healthy / Damaged

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
